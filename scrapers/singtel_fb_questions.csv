I'm not receiving any notifications for all my bills and the only way I'm finding out is after the money has been deducted from my bank account. No one likes their money being taken away without any prior warning right? It's a simple thing to send a notification for bills when they are done but it doesn't seem to be the case with Singtel.

on which SIngtel TV channel can i watch Indian Premier League IPL 2019?,https://www.facebook.com/singtel/posts/10156758627546677?comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22O%22%7D
"I received an email from Singtel to re-contract my SIM only plan for another 12 months (until 20 March 2020). I was supposed to be given 20GB + 150 free mins + 500 SMS + 12 months free caller ID. I followed the link and spoke to an online agent who helped me to do the re-contract on 19 March 2019. However, when I received the contract, I noticed I was not given the 20 GB as promised. I have spoken to 3 agents since. Each promised to rectify the problem for me. Today when I checked my account, it is still showing 7GB. I did not know re-contracting with SIngtel is so difficult. Each time I called, I have to go through all the verification and explained the issue. It is a pure waste of my time. I will terminate the account if this issue is still not rectified by Wed (exactly a week) and don't you dare to charge me for early termination!",https://www.facebook.com/singtel/posts/10156758596401677?comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22O%22%7D

Really appreciated the help and support from Randy Ong. He is indeed a knowledgeable and customer-focused retail executive who resolved the issues I had with unlocking the internet capability from my Singtel local phone to allow me to maximise my need for travelling internet for my overseas phone.

Wanted to ask about remote control of the setup box called customer service went to technical support...it did a self test ask me to reset and ended my call. No option on operator at all. Didn't even ask me on problem and all...customer service getting bad. All the automated option is just a frustrating waste of time.,https://www.facebook.com/singtel/posts/10156758336016677?comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22O%22%7D
