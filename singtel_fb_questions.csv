"Dear Singtel, your internet service is slow as hell. I can't even load a google search page. Stop throttling the internet.",
I have been waiting for 3 day no one can handle my Singtel TV problems. The staff who tell me to sign up a new contract is giving me the wrong information. Just don't understand how this can happen.,

"Hi Singtel, this is very disappointing. I tried to pre-order the new Samsung Galaxy S10+ on 23 Feb, Sat but was unable to self serve online since my contract is now under CIS and I would like to recontract as a normal user. Your CSO took my particulars and promised to arrange for a call in the next 1-2 working days.",

"Dear Singtel customer service, if you still ever exist, I hope you really would pay good attention to this message. I have lodged complaints a few times regarding harassment of overseas robotic spam calls received over a period of few weeks non-stop every day but nothing had been done on your end. As a telco and a giant one, I am amazed at your customer service and support.

"Dear Singtel, I understand that it was my hindsight that I overlooked on the bill payment. But this letter sent to me defeats its purpose. Firstly, the date of the letter and the payment cutoff date are both on the same day. Secondly, I only receive this letter on 27 Feb, way past the cutoff date. So no matter what, I have already incurred the late payment fee.",https://www.facebook.com/singtel/posts/10156709535121677?comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22O%22%7D

"Yours staffs from SingTel business hotline 1608 are irresponsible.
We shifted our office on Dec 18, ported all our lines to new office and we encounter multi issues like number is not valid, interrupted phone lines and many more. Called and feedback to your staffs from Singtel 1608 - Raphael, Jason Wong, Jean Mikhail, June Kathleen, Rommel... They doesn't solve our issues at all and they don't get back to us. Called and email but they doesn't seem to bother about it. Our business already been affected negatively. Requested for a technician on site, take forever from SingTel to confirm the date and time.
